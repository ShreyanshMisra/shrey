        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>There are some really cool classes at UMass. This is not a comprehensive list and I only listed the classes I took and really liked. Most of them also fulfil general education requirements. My advice is to also pick professors over classes. Most of the time, the professor is much more meorable than the class is. </p>
